A [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/) game focusing on lightning.

### Inspiration ###

* [How to Generate Shockingly Good 2D Lightning Effects](http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-generate-shockingly-good-2d-lightning-effects--gamedev-2681)
* Our final project for ["Art & Code & Interactivity"](https://github.com/shawnlawson/ArtCodeInteractivity) built using [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/)

### Motivation ###

We wanted to continue working on our final project while making it available on additional platforms, particularly mobile platforms with multi-touch support, with greater ease.
